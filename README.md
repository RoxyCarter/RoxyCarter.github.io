<li>"Good morning! I can't wait to see you today."</li>

<li>"Good morning! I'm sending you all my love and good vibes."</li>

<li>"Good morning! I hope you have a productive day."</li></ol>

No matter what you say, make sure your good morning text comes from the heart. It's a small gesture, but it can make a big difference in someone's day.
